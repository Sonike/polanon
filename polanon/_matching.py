"""Finding every occurrence of a value a conversation already masks.

A guard reports what it recognised, and a statistical one does not recognise the same string every
time. Once any occurrence of a value has a token, the pipeline masks every other occurrence too:
written exactly as before, and also in capitals, across a line break, with a no-break space or an
invisible character in it, and, for an identifier, with its groups written apart or together. The
exact search keeps every match a letter-for-letter search makes; the other searches only add to it.

Shared by the pipeline, which masks known values and the judge's findings, and by the output sweep,
which needs to know which parts of an answer are known values.
