"""Stable pseudonyms: one token for one value in every document, every process and every question.

Tokens numbered per call, such as ``<OSOBA_1>``, mean nothing outside the conversation that
handed them out, so a document masked for a search index and a question masked later can call
two different people ``<OSOBA_1>``, and the search finds nothing. A stable pseudonym is computed
instead: HMAC-SHA256 of the value's canonical form (see :mod:`polanon._canonical`) under a key
the application keeps secret, written as ``<OSOBA_482193047556>``. The same key gives the same
token for "Jan Kowalski" and "Jana Kowalskiego" in any process, with no shared state.

The key is what keeps the token from naming the value. A plain hash of a PESEL is undone by
hashing every possible PESEL, which a graphics card does in under a second; the HMAC needs the
key for each guess. Keep one key per company, and per index where the indexes must not be linked
(or give each a `scope`), and keep it out of the index, the logs and the source code. A new key,
scope or number of digits changes every token, so the index has to be built again.

Twelve digits leave a collision between two values of one type unlikely below about a hundred
thousand values, and possible at a million. One that does happen is detected wherever both values
meet, and the value that came second gets four digits more; `collisions` keeps the record of it.
